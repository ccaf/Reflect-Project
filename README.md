Reflect-Project is a platform for managing multiple multitouch devices in a classroom. If you are one teacher with twenty-five students and anywhere from a handful of devices to a one-to-one pairing, how do you control each device without physically being there? RP is the solution - it allows a teacher to send apps and content to devices, get feedback on student's progress, and project device contents to a big screen, all with one or two taps.
